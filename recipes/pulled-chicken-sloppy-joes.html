        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1/2 large yellow onion, diced</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp brown sugar, or to taste</li>
                <li>2 tsp kosher salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
                <li>2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
                <li>3/4 cup ketchup</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp hot sauce, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp thinly sliced green onions</li>
                <li>1/2 cup jalape&ntildeo pepper, diced</li>
                <li>4 medium hamburger buns - split, toasted and buttered</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add vegetable oil to a saucepan, and then add (in this order) garlic, yellow onion, brown sugar, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne, chicken thighs, ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.</li>
                <li>Place over high heat and wait until you can hear the garlic sizzling in the bottom of the pan, about 30 seconds. Let garlic sizzle for about 30 seconds before adding the water. Stir everything together and bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken falls apart, about 1.5 hours.</li>
                <li>Stir in the green onions and peppers and cook until the peppers just turn tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and serve on toasted hamburger buns.</li>
            </ol>
